those of you that frequent the dyson centre might have seen some of our robots, in particular, this freaky looking humanoid robot. Our club, Cambridge university robotics, is made up of multiple project teams that work on robots like this, be it for fun, or for competition. The wide variety of projects means that you can almost certainly find something interesting to work on, and if not, you can always start a project with us!

There is one caveat, which is that these robots are pretty complicated, so you might wonder how you can get started. Fear not, our club founders faced the same problem, and since 2018, we have been organising workshops to teach students how to get started with hardware and software. Some of you may already be participating in this year's Minibots, a soccer robot workshop and competition. Following that, we will also be organising an inter-university robotics competition called Unibots,  which is free for all to attend. These opportunities means that you can learn about robotics in a conducive environment before joining our big project teams!

If you'd like to keep in touch to join our projects or competitions, search for cur robotics on google, go to our website, and sign up. We hope to see you all soon! In the meantime, here's Dipanshu from the rescue team, who'll talk a bit about his project.
