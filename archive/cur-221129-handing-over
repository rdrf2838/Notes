Thanking people

Thanks to everyone for making the events we've held this term a success! in particular:

- Sylvia for taking care of our sponsors and planning the event with RS (even if it didn't happen in the end)
- Tian Ern and Chun Hei for an amazingly well-organised Minibots series of events
- Kate for managing all the outreach events, and signing us up for the best society (and sylvia too for outreach)

Despite our small size, I think we've been able to make an incredible impact, both among the students in cambridge, as well as the younger audience that we did outreach events with, and we should all be proud of ourselves for achieving this!

Anyways, on to the next steps:
- Feel free to stay on in the committee, or do something else that you enjoy
- I'm happy for Kate and Tian Ern to take over the society together - both pulled their weight in organizing meaningful events for the society. Maybe we can do the weird thing again with both a president (internal events) and a chairperson (external events), but entirely up to you people to decide
- Last year we started recruiting in week 4 of Lent, but we can probably start earlier. We didn't do much last time at the start of term, so we might as well recruit people to join when they are full of energy!

That's it from me (and probably for the rest of this year lol), all the best and have a great holiday! :)
