immediate tasks
	study linear programming
		need to be familiar with time complexity of said algorithms
plan to maximise happiness
	descriptions
		state
			my current state is always in 4D
			3 dimensions plus time
		event
			an event is a slice of time where I should be doing something
		plan
			a plan is a tree of events
				basically including branching if necessary
			each plan is motivated by how to maximise happiness
				e.g. in university, when working, etc

				can keep brainstorming
			each plan is orthogonal as long as there is enough time
				filler plans like studying that can be scaled up or down
