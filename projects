		federated scheduling
			may not have a signal analogous to CPU ready for containers
				CPU ready is a per VM metric that measures percentage of time that VM is ready but not run
				Run queue length is a host metric that measures fraction of processes that are running
				

		federated consensus
			how was this implemented? can implementation framework be used with the federated scheduling system too?

		Dear Dr. Kalyvianaki,

		I am Ivin, a 2nd year comsci. I'm currently looking for a Part II project supervisor, and some of your project suggestions seem pretty exciting! Hence, I would like to ask if you would be willing to supervise me.

		I am currently interested in systems such as distributed systems, operating systems etc. I gained this interest during an internship in first year, where I interacted with Kubernetes/Docker while working as a backend developer. I found it impressive that such distributed systems could manage a company's entire server and database systems dynamically. I also enjoyed the concurrent and distributed systems course this year, and I tried writing my own Optimistic Concurrency Control system (along other conc/dist patterns). This summer, I will be interning as a Core Dev to work on systems again. One thing I hope to do is to learn about and work on more advanced problems in system design. Hence, I would love to have the chance to tackle the scheduling and consensus problems that you have suggested.

		I understand that these topics require a good grasp of algorithms, maths and proof, and I think that I have the relevant skills. I did decently last year (10th/113), and in my free time, I have read some courses from the math tripos. You can take a look at my contributions to Dexter Chua's open source math notes.

		Thank you very much for taking the time to read this email!

		Best regards,

		Ivin Lee

		Dear Dr. Carata,

		I am Ivin, a 2nd year comsci. I'm currently looking for a Part II project supervisor, and some of your project suggestions seem pretty exciting! Hence, I would like to ask if you would be willing to supervise me.

		I am currently interested in systems such as operating systems, distributed systems etc. I gained this interest during an internship in first year, where I interacted with Kubernetes/Docker while working as a backend developer. I found it impressive that such systems could manage a company's entire server and database systems dynamically. I also tried writing my own Optimistic Concurrency Control system (along other conc/dist patterns) [...]. 

		One area I hope to work on is operating systems and kernel code, as I enjoy writing low-level code and learning about how these complex systems work. I would love to have the chance to work on 'Allow running eBPF programs on top of low-overhead probes (kamprobes)' and 'Linux-to-FreeBSD Kernel Module Translator', or any other OS-related projects.

		I understand that these projects require much familiarity with C. While not a particularly good substitute, I have done some competitive programming in C++ [...] and will be programming in C++ at a trading firm this summer as well. I understand that these don't constitute much experience, and I am open to suggestions on what else I can do to prepare over the summer.

		I have attached a copy of my CV for your perusal[...]. Thank you very much for taking the time to read this email!

		Dear Dr. Watson,

		I am Ivin, a 2nd year comsci. I'm currently looking for a Part II project supervisor, and some of your project suggestions seem pretty exciting! Hence, I would like to ask if you would be willing to supervise me.

I found it impressive that such systems could manage a company's entire server and database systems dynamically. I also tried writing my own Optimistic Concurrency Control system (along other conc/dist patterns) [...]. 

		I learnt about CHERI during the Computer Design course and I was particularly impressed by the emphasis on using formal methods to prove the correctness of the system, which is something that is often lacking in many systems. I also enjoyed my compilers course this year, and have gone on to read the 'Automata Theory' textbook that Dr Griffin suggested. Hence, I would love to have the chance to work on some of the projects you have suggested, namely 'CHERI code generation: From memory safety to type safety' and 'CHERI stack temporal safety', both of which involve CHERI and compilers.

		I understand that these projects require much familiarity with C and compiler behaviour. While not a particularly good substitute, I have done some competitive programming in C++ [...] and will be programming in C++ at a trading firm this summer as well. Regarding compilers, I've read Dr Griffin's Slang compiler implementation on his Github, and I'm planning to implement a compiler to WebAssembly as a side project. I understand that these don't constitute much experience, and I am open to suggestions on what else I can do to prepare over the summer.
